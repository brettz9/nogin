# Migrating to 1.0.0 (from `node-login`)

See [CHANGES](../CHANGES.md) for the full list of changes.

## Breaking changes

These are some very significant changes as we wanted to start fresh with
a clean break from `node-login` (despite it being useful and working),
but we realize it may not be easy if you have old data to migrate. Here are
some of the items you would need to adjust, but please note it is possible
there were other changes as well.

- Database
    - **Rename `pass_ver` to `passVer`**. You will have to update your
        database values yourself if you have old data with `pass_ver` (or
        with no value).
    - Add and apply **PBKDF2 hashing** (@SCG82), making this the default
        and only hashing scheme
    - **Add password into activation hash** so lesser chance for auto-enabling
        other users
- Config
    - Avoid **`process.env` in favor of CLI arguments** instead
        - In the process, we have also **avoided defaults for `NL_EMAIL_USER` and `NL_EMAIL_PASS`**
- **Page renaming**
    - Rename `/print` page to `/users` and require `showUsers` config (off
        by default) to show the page (see "Config" below)
    - Disable dangerous `/reset` GET access page (until such time as
        we may safely reenable as a POST API endpoint for privileged users
        and requiring confirmation)
- Internal
    - `EmailDispatcher` and `AccountManager` are now classes;
        `routes` accepts config; most likely other internal changes

## Changes

- Send error to user on home page if session is lost (instead of
    auto-redirecting to login)

## Security enhancements/fixes

- Make **"secret" private and configurable**
- Avoid ability for user to **update account to an existing email**.
- Pass **secret to cookie parser** as otherwise potentially problematic
- Use **signed cookie**
- Add `integrity`/`cross-origin=anonymous` for external scripts (`jquery.form`
    and `font-awesome` (switching to same CDN); add also
    for `github-fork-ribbon-css`)
- Minimize **XSS** vectors by using safer jQuery methods
- Use `user` from session (in case code is refactored to use
    the client-obtained variable, and there is a forgery)
- Add `express-rate-limit`-based **rate-limiting** (for protection
    against DoS)

## Fixes

- Change **error messages** (both for signup or updating) to indicate
    conditions when an email is changed but there is an error sending
    the activation link out (possibly due to a bad email address); was
    incorrectly reporting that the account had not been changed.
- Add proper **plain text attachment** for reset password email
- Disallow **empty user string** (for user attempting to visit `/home`)
- Fix (regression?): Give reset **password dialog proper sizing and display**
- (Fixes relative to [activation link PR](https://github.com/braitsch/node-login/pull/11)):
    - Ensure that **user can sign up again** if email dispatch fails
    - Avoid chance for clashes or unnecessary data by **deleting
        unactivated accounts** once one is activated.
    - Ensure all **activation-failed pages are status 400**
    - Add proper **plain text attachment** for activation email
    - Upon email update (via `/home`), dispatch email and require activation;
        ask user for confirmation before doing so (and inform user of
        consequences for confirmation)
    - Allow changing activation email template (with alternative JS
        template modules): `composeActivationEmailView`

## Updates

- Use now required **Mongodb APIs**
- **CDN** for bootstrap (CSS and JS), jquery, popper

## Enhancements

- **General**
    - Require **email verification** by link code (inspired by
      <https://github.com/braitsch/node-login/pull/11>)
    - Ensure that any `?redirect=` query parameter present in
      the path passed to root (`/` by default) is used for **redirecting after
      login**. (May also customize default redirect; see "Config")
    - **i18n**
        - Full i18n: server-side, client-side, and CLI, with caching of
            locale info for better performance
- **Server-side**
    - **Database abstraction layer** (currently Mongodb only)
    - **i18n of routes** (or customization; see "Config" below)
- **Client-side**
  - **Autocomplete hints** (name, user, email, country, new/current password)
  - Use **browser-native form validation**
  - **Accessibility**
      - Use h1+ headings; labels; roles (passing all except for
          `color-contrast` whose check we are temporarily disabling until
          may have time to fix)
- **New CLI** for adding, removing, updating, or viewing accounts (and
  listing indexes)
  - Includes help/version and `update-notifier` for notification of
      new available versions
- **Optimizations**
    - Add `use strict`
- **Config**
    - Optional override (i18nized) routes with config
    - Add `postLoginRedirectPath` option for users to redirect by
        default somewhere other than `/home` (or locale equivalent) after
        login.
    - Add option on **whether to require name** (`requireName`)
    - Allow pointing to **own locales base path** via `localesBasePath` option.
    - Allow changing email templates (with alternative JS template modules):
        - `composeActivationEmailView`
        - `composeResetPasswordEmailView`
    - Allow `country` as CLI add/remove/etc. verb option
    - Add `stylesheet` and `noBuiltinStylesheets`
    - Add `userJS` and `userJSModule`
    - Add `staticDir` and `middleware`
    - Add `router`
    - Add `injectHTML`
    - Add `countryCodes`
    - Add `localScripts` option for using non-CDN copies
    - Add `fromText` and `fromURL` for password reset emails
    - Add `NS_EMAIL_TIMEOUT` option
    - Add `showUsers` config (on by default) to disable `/users` list page
        as can be a privacy leak if users not intended to be public
        (may reset back to default in the future if made safely based
        on privilege levels)

## Refactoring

- JavaScript
    - More **ES6** features
    - Linting (ESLint): Apply **eslint-config-ash-nazg** as well as
        `cypress`, `chai-expect`, `chai-friendly` plugins
    - Convert further APIs to **return Promises** (async/await)
    - Further **separation of view logic** out of controllers
    - Use **variables in place of selectors** where possible
- CSS
    - Utilize **succincter stylus features**
- HTML
    - Avoid **inline styles**
    - Switch from **PUG to Jamilih templates** (Pug is nicely terse, but
        wanted pure JS environment)
        - Add **scripts to head** with `defer`

    and **email receipt checking**
- Testing: Full **100% UI (or CLI) testing coverage**

- npm: Mongodb and server start **npm scripts**; misc. testing and badge
    generation scripts
- npm: Add recommended **`package.json` fields**; bump to Node >= 10.4.0 in
    `engines`
